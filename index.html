          <h2>Bio(graphical)</h2>
          <p>A bit about me</p>
          <p>Ever since I was a kid I have loved running.  They only problem seemed to be that I couldn't run in a straight line.  Mother used to tie me to the clothes line so I could practice, but I kept zigging and zagging.  The day we went to Aunt Maudes farm was the day my life changed.  Cousin Rupert accidently let go of the dinner chicken, and it ran free.  No one could catch it, not even Cletis, who had two legs the same lenth!  Mother looked at me, and in that momment I knew what I was destined to do.  That chicken zigged and zagged but I zagged when it zigged and snatched that chicken up.  I found my calling and, now I am the best free range chicken catcher in all of Oregon!<p/>

            <p>Home school wasn't even a thing back then.  Light sockets, don't stick a fork in them.  I'm a fast learner, no one had to teach me that, learned it all by myself.</p>

          <p>Lofty Ideals</p>
          <p>Working as free range chicken catcher has been as rewarding a blessing from heaven, but I know that life has more in store for me.  There are greater things on the horizon for me as I see myself moving twords bigger and better things.  Someone has to catch those turkeys, so it may as well be me.  And someday, maybe, I'l just grab that bull by its horns.</p>

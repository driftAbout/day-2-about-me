          <p>A bit about me</p>
          <p>Ever since I was a kid I have loved to run.  They only problem seemed to be that I couldn't run in a straight line.  Mother used to tie me to the clothes line so I could practice, but I kept zigging and zagging.  The day we went to Aunt Maudes farm was the day my life changed.  Cousin Rupert accidently let go of the dinner chicken and it ran free.  No one could catch it, not even Cletis who had two legs the same lenth!  Mother looked at me and in that momment I knew what I was destined to do.  That chicken zigged and zagged but I zagged when it zigged and snatched that chicken up.  I found my calling and, now I am the best free range chicken catcher in all of Oregon!<p/>
